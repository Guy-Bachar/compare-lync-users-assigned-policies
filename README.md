This script will compare two Lync users to find the differences in settings of users based on their assigned policies.


we ([@y0av](http://y0av.me/) and [@GuyBachar](http://guybachar.us)) wrote this script in order to save Lync admins time in troubleshooting scenarios where we are trying to verify why user A is capable of certain functionalities that
 user B is not capable of, and in order to do so we are required to search for the applied policies first and then compare them to see the differences manually by using the Lync Control Panel.


The script allows you to export the results to an HTML Report as well.
